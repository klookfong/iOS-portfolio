## About The Project

<img src="/Twitter/mock.gif" width="400" height="300" />

Creating a clone of Twitter using SwiftUI. Does not include any real tweeting functionality, this is solely to show off the UI elements of Twitter in SwiftUI. 

This project contains a collection of sample tweets, all with one author (myself), and has the like functionality, and the follow functionality, although the data will not persist due to the lack of a backend.
